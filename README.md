What they do? 

Databases are logical structures used to organize and store data for future processing, retrieval, or evaluation, these structures are nearly always managed by an application called a database management system or DBMS.

When to use them? 

Data persistence vs ephemeral storage
When the data need to be persistent, meaning that the data is reliable saved for later, even if the database application or the computer itself restarts.
When the data need to be ephemeral or volatile. Ephemeral storage does not survive application or system shutdown.

Why do we use them? 

Databases can store very large numbers of records efficiently.
It is very quick and easy to find information.
It’s possible to add new data and edit or delete old data quicker.
Data can be imported into other applications.
More than one entity can access the same database at the same time – multi-access.
Security may be better than in paper files.

How are they different?

Relational Databases
NoSQL Databases
Graph Databases.
Cloud Databases.

Importance of them?

Databases provide a systematic way to store data and ensure its integrity, security, and accessibility. (ACID).
Without databases, managing the data especially as it grows in complexity and size, it would be cumbersome and error-prone.

Criteria for choosing a database

Key considerations when choosing a Database and DBMS.

Understand your project’s requirements.
Data Model.
Data Consistency.
Data Security.
Data Protection.
Multi access and integration.
Efficiency.
Usability.
Implementation and Service Costs.
